# Task A – Dev-Safe Jail Notes

- Added a new `--jail=/path` flag to `zencube/sandbox.c`. When running as root the child process will perform a chroot to the resolved jail directory before `execvp`. If the sandbox is launched without root privileges the code logs a warning and proceeds without chroot.
- The jail flag performs defensive checks before forking: the directory must exist, resolve with `realpath`, be accessible (execute bit) and be a directory. These checks surface configuration errors early.
- Implemented `monitor/jail_wrapper.py` for development-time enforcement. The wrapper prefers `strace -f -e trace=file` to audit file opens; if `strace` is unavailable it falls back to scanning `/proc/<pid>/fd` while the command runs. Detected escapes trigger a non-zero exit code (`2`) and are logged to `monitor/logs/jail_run_*.json`.
- Wrapper allow-list: accesses under the jail root are permitted along with a minimal set of system paths (lib/bin directories, `/dev`, `/proc`, the interpreter bootstrap files, and `~/.local` caches) so that interpreters can boot. Any attempt to read `/etc/hosts` (or similar outside content) is flagged.
- Added `scripts/build_jail_dev.sh` to assemble a non-root chroot directory (`sandbox_jail/`) containing `/bin/sh`, required shared libraries, and a stub `etc/passwd`. This script helps developers prepare a directory tree that the production chroot will accept.
- Created `tests/test_jail_dev.sh` which exercises the wrapper, verifies it returns exit code `2`, and confirms that the latest log mentions `/etc/hosts`. A helper Python probe (`testbins/try_read_outside.py`) lives in the repo and is copied into the jail before execution.
- `monitor/logs/` now captures JSON reports per wrapper run including the method used (`strace` or `proc_fd`) and any violations, enabling lightweight auditing without root.
- Remaining follow-up: run the new test script after building the jail, update the checklist, record test evidence in `phase3/TEST_RUNS.md`, and complete the final scoring once validations pass.
- Native GUI integration (PySide6): the new `gui/file_jail_panel.py` widget is attached inside `zencube/zencube_modern_gui.py` via `attach_file_jail_panel`. This keeps Task A accessible from the existing PySide6 interface instead of relying on the removed web JSX prototype.
- The panel enforces dev-safe defaults by routing Prepare/Run actions through `build_jail_dev.sh` and `monitor/jail_wrapper.py`, streaming wrapper output directly into the GUI while surfacing sudo commands only as instructions.

# Task B – Network Restrictions Notes

- Added a seccomp-based `--no-net` flag in `zencube/sandbox.c`. The filter denies `socket`, `connect`, `sendto`, `sendmsg`, `recvfrom`, and `recvmsg`, returning `EPERM` so userland can surface a `PermissionError` without killing the process.
- When seccomp cannot be installed (common on non-root dev hosts) the sandbox logs the failure and the GUI falls back to `monitor/net_wrapper.py`, which monkey patches Python's `socket` module and logs attempts to `monitor/logs/net_restrict_*.json`.
- The new GUI Network panel mirrors the file-jail workflow: dev-safe mode auto-wraps commands, enforce mode surfaces the exact `sudo sandbox --no-net ...` invocation instead of attempting privileged changes.
- `scripts/disable_network_dev.sh` demonstrates the optional `unshare --net` approach without persisting iptables changes; failures are logged to `monitor/logs/net_namespace_*.log`.
- Regression test `tests/test_network_restrict.sh` compiles the sandbox if needed, runs a socket probe through the wrapper, asserts the run fails, and verifies that a log file with at least one event exists.
